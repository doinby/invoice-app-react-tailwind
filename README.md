# Frontend Mentor - Invoice app solution

Invoice App is a modern solution to help people keeping track of the day-to-day invoices and receipts. No more crumbly, faded receipts at the bottom of a drawer at tax time! Works seamlessly with ALL screen sizes.

This is a solution to the [Invoice app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl).
